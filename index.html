    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I come from India. My journey into engineering began at home, 
      breaking open RC cars and game consoles out of curiosity. That same curiosity led me to computers, and eventually to systems programming.
      <br><br>
      Influenced by the greats like Alan Turing and John von Neumann, and guided by mentors such as Prof. Jyotiprakash Mishra, 
      I am drunk and stoned deep into the nasha of  embedded systems, systems-level programming, and VLSI engineering. I believe that understanding 
      the core of how things work; from screws to semiconductors; enables real innovation.
      <br><br>
      Hardwork beats talent. But when talent works had, its game over.
      <br><br>
      If you stumbled across this by chance, it wasn't an accident. The universe gives signs. You have exactly 3 days to live.

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>

    Gita - Compiled by <a href="https://blog.jyotiprakash.org/">Jyotiprakash Mishra</a> [<a href="../papers/Gita.pdf">pdf</a>]
    <p>
      Sometimes you have to be a bit too optimistic to make a difference.      <br><br>
      I believe in thinking deeply, tinkering endlessly, and never settling for surface-level understanding.
      I hate Machine Learning. I love low level.
      You must place yourself in a position to give maximum glory to your Creator. So you go out there, and you be somebody glorious.
