    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I come from India. My journey into engineering began at home, 
      breaking open RC cars and game consoles out of curiosity. That same curiosity led me to computers, and eventually to systems programming.
      <br><br>
      Influenced by the greats like Alan Turing and John von Neumann, and guided by mentors such as Prof. Jyotiprakash Mishra, 
      I am now diving deep into embedded systems, systems-level programming, and VLSI engineering. I believe that understanding 
      the core of how things work—from screws to semiconductors—enables real innovation.

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes you have to be a bit too optimistic to make a difference.      <br><br>
      I believe in thinking deeply, tinkering endlessly, and never settling for surface-level understanding.
      I hate Machine Learning. I love low level.
